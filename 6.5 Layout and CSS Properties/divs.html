The purpose of HTML is to add meaning and structure to the content. It is not intented to provide instructions for how the content should look.

When marking up your document, choose elements semantically i.e. in a way that most accurately describes the content's meaning.

If the purpose of grouping elements is simply to provide a hook for styling, use the generic div element instead of the HTML 5 semantic elements.

If the content is self-contained and could appear outside the current context, it is best marked up as an article.
ex:

<article>
    <h1>Get to Know Edmond</h1>
    <section>
        <h2>History of Edmond</h2>
        <p>.....</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2>Edmond Today</h2>
        <p>......</p>
    </section>
</article>
